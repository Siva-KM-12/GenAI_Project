# ðŸ¤– E-commerce AI Agent

This project implements an AI-powered E-commerce Data Analyst Agent that allows users to query their sales and advertising data using natural language. The agent converts natural language questions into SQL queries, executes them against a SQLite database, and provides human-readable answers along with relevant data visualizations.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Natural Language to SQL:** Converts user questions into executable SQLite SQL queries using a local Large Language Model (LLM) (Mistral via Ollama).
*   **Data Ingestion:** Automatically ingests sales, advertising, and product eligibility data from Excel files into a SQLite database.
*   **Dynamic Data Visualization:** Generates various types of charts (bar, line, pie, etc.) based on query results to provide visual insights.
*   **Flask API:** Provides a RESTful API for handling natural language queries and returning structured responses.
*   **Interactive Frontend:** A simple web interface for users to ask questions and view results and visualizations.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** Includes a basic fallback system for common queries if the LLM fails to generate a valid SQL.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors during LLM interaction, SQL execution, and data processing.
